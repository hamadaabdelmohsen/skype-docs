# UCMA 5.0 Runtime

**Applies to**: Skype for Business 2015

An administrator who is preparing to install a third-party UCMA-enabled application on a deployment computer must download and install UcmaRuntimeSetup.exe. Installing Microsoft Unified Communications Managed API 5.0 Runtime provides all of the UCMA-related functionality needed by a UCMA-enabled application.

## UCMA 5.0 Runtime requirements

The following are the hardware and software requirements for installing UCMA 5.0 Runtime:

- The target platform must be a 64-bit computer.

- Supported operating systems:
    
  - Windows 2012 Server R2   
  - Windows 2012 Server   
  - Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1   
  - Windows 8.1   
  - Windows 8   
  - Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (SP1) (64-bit): Home Premium, Professional, or Ultimate editions
    
  > [!NOTE]
  > Auto-provisioned applications cannot be deployed on computers running Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7 or Windows Vista.

- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 (Full Profile)
    
  - Windows 8 and later versions include .NET Framework 4.5.    
  - Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1 includes .NET Framework 4.5.    
  - Windows 7 includes .NET Framework 3.5, so you must update to .NET Framework 4.5.

- Antivirus software
    
  Antivirus software can sometimes make such heavy demands on the CPU as to cause audio glitches. For this reason, antivirus software is not recommended for computers running Skype for Business Server 2015. For optimal performance for a server that must run antivirus software, include all Skype for Business Server 2015 computers in the antivirus software’s exception list.
